## What is it?

The UAH Sounding Program (USP) converts raw radiosonde data into several formats and generates [SHARPpy](https://sharppy.github.io/SHARPpy/)-based Skew-T Log-P plots. It leverages several Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SHARPpy) to convert raw iMet or Windsond files into formats compatible with [RAOB](https://www.raob.com/), SHARPpy, and a general research format. USP also outputs custom SHARPpy plots serving as quick-looks for your data.
